# BUILD AN ITEM CATALOG APPLICATION

Pranay Marella's submission for Udacity's Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree

## About
This project focuses on learning how to build a RESTful web application. I also learned how to use Google API's and OAuth 2.0 for securing user login. Also learned how to provide JSON endpoints for application. This provides a basic understanding about how to build a simple online store for users to browse through and only authenticated users will be able to make changes to items.

## What's Included
1. Static Folder - contains css/js files
2. Templates Folder - contains html templates
3. catalog.db - sqlite db that I used, feel free to create your own
4. client_secrets.json - used for Google API's and OAuth flow
5. models.py - contains the data model for Users, Categories, and Items
6. views.py - Main content of the application

## Requirements
* Vagrant
* GitBash

## How to Run

* Clone or Download the file 'Item_Catalog_Application.zip'
* Extract it into the destination where you can share files with Vagrant (ex. if vagrant folder in desktop, extract to -> C:\Users\UserName\Desktop\vagrant\)
* Open GitBash and Change Directory to within Vagrant
* If Vagrant is not setup, run 'vagrant up'. After, run 'vagrant ssh' to get the virtual machine running
* Go into the Item_Catalog_Application folder in the virtual machine
* Run the command 'Python views.py' and go to 'http://localhost:5000/' in your browser to begin
